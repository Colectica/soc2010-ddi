# Describing the Standard Occupational Classification 2010 (SOC2010) in DDI 3.2

## Overview

This project uses the Data Documentation Initiativeâ€™s DDI 3.2 XML standard to document the SOC2010 occupation codes.

## SOC2010

From [ONS](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/classifications/current-standard-classifications/soc2010/index.html):

> The standard occupational classification 2010 (SOC2010) is a common classification of occupational information for the UK.
> 
> Within the context of the classification, jobs are classified in terms of their skill level and skill content.

The classification is available in spreadsheet format [here](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/classifications/current-standard-classifications/soc2010/soc2010-structure--excel-download-.xls).

## DDI 

Again from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Documentation_Initiative):

> The Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) is an international project to
> create a standard for information describing statistical and social
> science data. Begun in 1995, the effort brings together data
> professionals from around the world to develop the standard. The DDI
> specification, written in XML, provides a format for content,
> exchange, and preservation of information.
